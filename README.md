# Overview
This repository hosts the source code for three distinct machine learning models, each fine-tuned for specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks:

1. **Text Emotion Recognition:** Classifies the emotional content in a given text.
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes text to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
3. **Cyberbullying Detection and Classification:** Identifies and categorizes instances of online harassment or bullying.
